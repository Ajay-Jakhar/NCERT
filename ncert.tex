\item How many times must a man toss a fair coin so that the probability of having
at least one head is more than 90\%?
\item In a hurdle race, a player has to cross 10 hurdles. The probability that he will clear each hurdle is $\dfrac{5}{6}$. What is the probability that he will knock down fewer than 2 hurdles?
\item Three letters are dictated to three persons and an envelope is addressed to each
of them, the letters are inserted into the envelopes at random so that each envelope
contains exactly one letter. Find the probability that at least one letter is in its
proper envelope.
\item Consider the experiment of throwing a die, if a multiple of 3 comes up, throw the die again and if any other number comes, toss a coin. Find the conditional probability of the event 'the coin shows a tail',given that 'atleast one die shows a 3'.
\item A die is thrown again and again until three sixes are obtained. Find the probability of obtaining the third six in the sixth throw of the die.
\item Let X represent the difference between the number of heads and the number of
tails obtained when a coin is tossed 6 times. What are possible values of X?
